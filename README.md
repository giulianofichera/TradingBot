# TradingBot

## Initial release.
### Many things are not still fully functional.  
### NO responsibility will be taken for the use of this bot. Use at your OWN RISK

While trading cryptocurrencies, I encountered bots that 'one-upped' offers every time someone made a leading offer. This sometimes happens on both sides of the order book.  

This bot works on this principle to see up to what point the bots would continue one-upping my offers from both buy and sell sides.  
In the case that an overlap exists, there is a possibility to buy and sell at a higher price almost immediately.
